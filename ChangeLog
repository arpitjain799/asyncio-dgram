1.0.1:
	- bind() no longer explicitly disables SO_REUSEADDR as upstream deprecated
	the option.

1.0.0:
	- bind() no longer sets SO_REUSEADDR by default.  See upstream discussion
	for rationale, https://bugs.python.org/issue37228

	- DatagramStream.send() will now wait for the asyncio write buffer to
	drain below the highwater mark before returning.  This mimics the
	forthcoming behavior from upstream, https://bugs.python.org/issue38242
